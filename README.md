# Introduction
This repo contains the lab assignment, tutorials and useful code for the [Mobile and distributed computing systems (d7024e)](https://www.ltu.se/en/education/course/d70/d7024e-mobile-and-distributed-computing-systems) course at Luleå University of Technology.

## [Tutorials](tutorials/)
Step-by-step tutorials covering Go programming aspects for distributed systems, from basic project setup to implementing a distributed algorithms. These tutorials provide the foundational knowledge needed for the course assignments.

## [Laboratory Assignments](lab/)
Laboratory assignments can be found here. These hands-on assignments allow you to apply the concepts learned in lectures and tutorials to practical distributed systems problems.

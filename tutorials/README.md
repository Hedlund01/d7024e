# Go Distributed Systems Tutorials
This repository contains a sries of tutorials for building distributed systems in Go, covering howto set up a basic project to implementing a distributed algorithm.

## Tutorial Overview
The tutorials are designed to be completed in sequence, with each building upon concepts from previous lessons:

1. Creating a New Go Project
Learn how to set up a Go project following best practices using the CPS `go-template`. Covers project structure, dependency management, and build automation with GitHub Actions.

2. Understanding HelloWorld
Deep dive into the CLI architecture using the Cobra framework. Explore project organization, structured logging with Logrus, and the separation of concerns between CLI and application logic.

3. Go Routines
Learn how to develop and test Go's concurrency primitives including goroutines, channels, and synchronization patterns. This is essential foundation for building concurrent distributed systems.

4. Mocking Networks
Learn about network simulation and testing techniques. Implement mock network layers to test distributed algorithms in controlled environments without real network dependencies.

5. Implementing and Testing a Distributed Algorithm
Put it all together by implementing a complete distributed algorithm. Apply testing strategies, network simulation, and proper Go project structure to build a production-ready distributed system.

## Prerequisites
* Go 1.19 or higher
* Git with SSH keys configured
* Basic understanding of command-line tools
* Familiarity with distributed systems concepts (recommended)

## Getting Started
* Start with tutorial 1 to set up your development environment
* Follow the tutorials in order - each builds on the previous one
* Complete all exercises and examples in each tutorial
* Refer back to earlier tutorials as needed

## Learning Objectives
By completing this tutorial series, you will:
* Understand Go project organization and best practices
* Master Go's concurrency model and goroutines, both test and development
* Build robust CLI applications using industry-standard frameworks
* Test distributed systems using mock networks
* Apply proper testing strategies for concurrent and distributed code

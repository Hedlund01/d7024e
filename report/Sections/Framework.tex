In this section, we will discuss the various frameworks and technologies that are being utilized in the project. This includes both the backend and frontend technologies, as well as any other tools that are essential for the development process.

\begin{list}{}
    \item \textbf{Programming language:} Go is used as the primary programming language for the backend services, leveraging its concurrency features and performance.
    \item \textbf{Logging:} Logrus is used for structured logging in the application, providing a simple API for logging that allows to pass the container ip address for each log entry to easily identify which node the log entry originated from.
    \item \textbf{Containerization:} Docker in swarm mode is used for container orchestration, enabling the management of multiple containers.
    \item \textbf{Automation:} Bash scripts are employed to automate common tasks such as building and deploying the application, making it easier to manage the deployment and development process.

\section{Sprint 0}
During sprint 0 we setup the project repository from the Github template given in the course. We also configured a containerization strategy using Docker in swarm mode. We established bash scripts to automate common tasks, such as building and deploying the application. This lets us with a simple script deploy up to n instances, where n is a argument for the deploy script, with ease. Utilizing these scripts, we can easily scale up and down the number of instances in our swarm and Kademlia network in the upcoming sprints.

After setting up the containerization tools, we started on the implementation of finding nodes in the same docker network and establishing communication between them. Our approach involved DNS lookups via the docker DNS service, to get the docker ip addresses of the other containers in the same docker swarm stack. The drawback of this approach is that the containers that start up early won't be able to find the containers that start up later, since they don't exist yet. We didn't solve this problem yet, as we will implement Kademlia protocol for peer discovery to address these issues in the upcoming sprint.

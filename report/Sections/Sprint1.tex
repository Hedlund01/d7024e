\section{Sprint 1}

\subsection{Planned work}

As illustrated in Figure 1 \ref{fig:todos_for_sprints_at_sprint_0}, the plan is to complete all underlying functionality (M1–M7) during the first sprint. 
Subsequently, focus will shift to the qualification goals (U1–U5). This structure was chosen because establishing and verifying the core functionality 
first ensures a stable foundation, which in turn facilitates the successful implementation of the qualification objectives.

\subsection{Organizing Sprints}

To structure and organize the work efficiently, GitHub Projects is used to create a storyboard for both sprints. The storyboard is available under the 
Projects tab in the repository, providing an overview of the workflow throughout the course.
